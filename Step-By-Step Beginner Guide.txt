STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
==================

This is a step-by-step guide for first-time users of the Automated Meter Reading
File Handler v1.4 program. For more detailed information on the program,
licenses, troubleshooting, setup, and advanced configuration, see the
"README.md" file.

This program requires a modern web browser capable of running most HTML5 code.
If you are using the latest Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, or
Firefox, you should be fine. Google chrome is recommended. For more information,
see the "README.md" file, section 3.

The "README.md" can be viewed with a web browser or text editor, but is meant to
be viewed from GitHub at:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Download Brackets.

    Go to http://brackets.io to download the software.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Get your API Access keys - there are 3 of them: Application Key, Access
        Key, API Secret Key.

    Go to http://www.fiixsoftware.com/api/docs/guide.html#api_keys for
    details on how to get your keys.
    
    Write the keys down, they'll be needed later.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Put your meter reading CSV files in the "data" folder.

    Make sure that all of the files follow the following pattern:

        <number><name>.csv

    The <name> has to remain the same across all files, while the <number> has
    to start with 1 and then increase by 1 for each csv file. 

    To see an example set of files, go to the "EXdata" folder in the "examples"
    folder. For this guide, the example file is "1data.csv". To read an
    explanation for the other example files, see the "README.md" file, section
    11.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Configure the "config.txt" file in the "config" folder.

    IMPORTANT: The settings data is put immediately after the tildes (“~”).
    There are 18 settings in total, labelled from 0 to 17.

    To view an example configuration, see the "EXconfig.txt" in the "examples"
    folder.
    
    NOTE: For this step, everything following ">>>" are instructions only.



    API SETUP  (Mandatory)
    ---------

    0: API URL

    >>> Type the redirect URL. It is your cmms url with /api/ added to the end.


    1: Application Key

    >>> Place the application key in this setting.


    2: Access Key

    >>> Place the access key in this setting.


    3: API Secret Key

    >>> Place the API secret key in this setting.


    FORMAT SETUP (Optional)
    ------------

    4: Meter Reading Only  (Optional)
  
    >>> Description: This setting is for files that only have one column of data
        with no headings. (see example file "2data.csv”). Using this setting
        requires settings 6, 7, and 8.

    >>> Setting: Put a "0" to turn off the setting, or change to "1" to turn it
        on.


    5: Delimiter  (Optional)
   
    >>> Description: This setting is for files which aren't using a comma as the
        delimiter. For more information, see the "README.md" file, sections 6.2
        and 11.3.

    >>> Setting: Leave this setting as blank.


    6: Quotation Wrapped Data (Optional)

    >>> Description: This setting is for CSV files which put quotations ("")
        around the data.
        
        IMPORTANT: This is common in CSV files. The easiest way to tell if
        your CSV files have quotations around each item in every row is to open
        the file using Notepad (on Windows), or an equivalent basic text editing
        program.
    
    >>> Setting: Leave as "0" to turn off the setting, or change to "1" to turn
        it on.


    7: Automatic Date Reading  (Optional)
   
    >>> Description: This setting is for when the CSV files don't have a dates
        column. (see example file "5data.csv”). It gives the Meter Readings the
        day and time of when the  program read the file instead.

    >>> Setting: Leave as "0" to turn off the setting, or change to "1" to turn
        it on.


    8: Set Default ID  (Optional)
   
    >>> Description: This setting is for when the CSV files don't have an Asset
        ID column. (see example file "4data.csv”). It links the Meter Readings
        to the asset ID specified in this setting.

    >>> Setting: Leave this setting empty to ignore it, or enter an Asset ID.


    9: Set Default Unit  (Optional)
  
    >>> Description: This setting is for when the CSV files don't have a unit
        column. (see example file "5data.csv”). It tells the CMMS that all the
        meter readings read by this program are in the unit stated in this
        setting.

    >>> Setting: Leave this setting empty to ignore it, or enter a unit of
        measurement registered in the CMMS.


    FILE SETUP
    ----------

    10: File Name (Mandatory)

    >>>	Setting: Enter the name used for all of the files here. Make sure to
        include the .csv at the end.


    11: Asset ID Column Header (Mandatory)

    >>> Setting: Enter the header for the column in the files containing the IDs
        of the assets the meter readings are related to. The same header must
        exist in all files.

        IMPORTANT: The asset ID is different from the asset code! To view asset
        IDs, take the following steps:
    
        1. Log into the CMMS (if not already logged in).
        2. Select Assets from the menu on the left.
        3. Click on the "Set Visible Columns" button.
            -On a desktop, the button is a small image of a list made of squares
            and rectangles, located to the far right of the page, above the list
            of assets.
        4. Check the box labelled "id".
        5. Click the "OK" button.
        6. The ID value of the assets should appear as a new column in the list.


    12: Meter Reading Value Column Header (Mandatory)

    >>> Setting: Enter the header for the column in the files containing the
        meter reading values. The same header must exist in all files.


    13: Meter Reading Value Unit Measurement Column Header (Mandatory)

    >>> Setting: Enter the header for the column in the files containing the
        dates that the meter readings were taken at. The same header must exist
        in all files.

            -For best results, use RFC2822 or ISO 8601 format for the
             dates. Information on them can be found at:

                http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14
                http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime-970915.html


    14: Date Column Header (Mandatory)

    >>>	Setting: Enter the header for the column in the files containing the
        meter reading values. The same header must exist in all files.


    15: Work Order ID Column Header (Optional)
 
    >>> Description: Use this setting to attach a work order ID to a meter
        reading. Not every meter reading has to have a work order ID. If a meter
        reading has a blank work order ID, it will be treated like a normal
        meter reading. The same header must exist in all files for the program
        to use this setting. (see example file "6data.csv”).

    >>> Setting: Leave this setting blank to ignore it, or enter the heading for
        the column containing Work Order IDs.


    BATCHING SETUP
    --------------
    
    16: Maximum Batch Requests per Minute (Mandatory)

    >>>	Description: This setting controls the number of meter readings sent to
        the server every minute.

    >>> Setting: Leave this setting as 200.


    17: Time Delay Between Files (Mandatory)

    >>> Description: This setting controls the number of minutes the program
        waits after finishing a file upload before it begins the next one.
 
    >>> Setting: Leave this setting as 30.



    RESET
    -----

    18: Reset the File and Position Tracking (Optional)

    >>> Description: The Reset The File And Position Tracking setting is for
        advanced usage. For more information, see the "README.md" file,
        section 6.5.

    >>> Setting: Leave this setting as 0.



    Once finished configuring the config.txt file, save and close it. Make sure
    it is saved as "config.txt" in the "config" folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The program is now ready to be run. Take the following steps to start
    sending meter reading data to the CMMS. Make sure the CSV data files are
    saved to the data folder (it was empty when you first downloaded it).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5:	Open the "Runnable.html" file with the Brackets software.

    IMPORTANT:
    Do not double click the "Runnable.html" file. It will not work outside of
    the Brackets software.

    You will need to run the program by either right clicking the
    "Runnable.html" file, selecting "open with", and choosing the Brackets
    software.
    
    It can also be done by opening the Brackets software, going to the "File"
    menu, selecting "Open", and finding the "Runnable.html" file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: To start running the program and pushing the CSV data to your CMMS, 
        Select the "Live Preview" setting in Brackets. This setting can be found
        in the File menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Make sure the program is running properly.

    The live preview function should open a new tab in your web browser. The new
    tab will tell you the state of the program. If there are any issues with the
    running of the program, see the "README.md" file, section 8, for
    troubleshooting.
